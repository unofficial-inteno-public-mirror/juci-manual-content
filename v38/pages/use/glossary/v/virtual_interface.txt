# Virtual Network Interface

Virtual network interfaces are linked to a hardware device, but are not hardware devices.

A virtual network interface is generally associated with a physical network, another virtual interface, a loopback interface or other standalone interfaces.

### Types of Virtual Network Interfaces

^ Type ^ Example ^ Description ^
| Aliases | `eth4:5, eth4:6` | Used to handle multiple IP-addresses per interface. Supported for backwards compatibility. |
| Bridges | `br0, br-lan` | Used to make multiple network interfaces behave as one network interface. |
| Stacked VLANs | `10, 20` | IEEE 802.1ad type network, using two or more tags in each packet. |
| Special purpose | `imq0, teql3` | Used to change the order of outgoing or incoming network packets. |
| Tunnel interfaces | `pppoe-dsl, tun0, vpn1` | Used to send packets over a tunneling protocol. |
| VLANs | `eth4.0, vlan0` | Used to separate a network into multiple virtual networks. |
| Wireless operating mode virtual interfaces | `wlan0, ath3` | A wireless subsystem created automatically for a wireless [NIC](/glossary/n/nic) master interface. |
