# WPA2 Enterprise

Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 Enterprise is designed for enterprise networks and requires an authentication server.

It provides additional security (e.g. protection against dictionary attacks on short passwords).

Various kinds of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) are used for authentication.
