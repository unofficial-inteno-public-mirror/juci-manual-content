The Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) is an [LLC](/glossary/l/llc) extension used to distinguish additional higher layer protocols compared to [LSAP](/glossary/l/lsap).

SNAP fields allow the receiving node to pass each received frame to an appropriate device driver which understands given protocol.
