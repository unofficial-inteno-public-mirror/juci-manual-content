# Classify

The **classify** tab lets you configure filtering parameters in order to have [Classification groups](/glossary/q/qos_group) applied to particular types of traffic.

##

At the top of the page is a list of selectable classification groups.

When a particular group is selected, details about it is shown in the configuration section.

Adding a parameter will filter out traffic according to the parameters and assign the target group to it.
