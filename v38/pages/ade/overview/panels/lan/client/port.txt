# Port Forwarding

In the **Port Forwarding** tab you can map incoming connections on different [ports](/glossary/p/port) to ports on the client.


## Mapping Section

^ Item ^ Description ^
| Name | Port name. |
| Excluded ports | Protected ports that can't be mapped.  |
| Public port | Public (external) port. |
| Private port | Private (client) port. |
| Protocol | Protocol. |


###  Protocol

The protocol setting filters traffic by protocol for the port forward.

^ Protocol ^ Description ^
| TCP + UDP | Both [TCP](/glossary/t/tcp) and [UDP](/glossary/u/udp). |
| TCP | [TCP](/glossary/t/tcp) only. |
| UDP | [UDP](/glossary/u/udp) only.  |
| All | Any protocol. |



## Mapping Settings

To map incoming connections:

* Click **Add mapping** to open the mapping section

The mapping section lets you add configuration settings for the mapping.

Ports can be added one by one (`80`), as comma-separated lists (`8080, 8090`) or as ranges (`21-22`).

* Add information:

    * Add a name as identification

    * Add ports:

        * Add public/incoming port(s)

        * Add private/client port(s)

    * Select protocol

* Click **Save**

Your information has now been saved and is visible in the mapping list.
