# SIP Server/Registrar

A SIP server (also called SIP Registrar or SIP Proxy) handles [SIP](/glossary/s/sip) management for a [IP](/glossary/i/ip)-based [private branch exchange](/glossary/p/pbx).

It handles setup and connections for SIP calls in a network, but does not handle actual transmission of real-time data.
