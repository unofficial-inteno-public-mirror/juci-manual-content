# Network interface

A wireless interface is the access point to a [wireless radio](/glossary/w/wireless_radio). Interfaces are identified by their
[SSID](/glossary/s/ssid).

Each radio can have several SSIDs and each SSID interface can be configured as part of a [network bridge](/glossary/n/network_bridge) or [firewall group](/glossary/f/firewall_group).
