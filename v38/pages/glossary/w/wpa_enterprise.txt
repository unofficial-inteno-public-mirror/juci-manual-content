# WPA Enterprise

Also referred to as WPA-802.1X mode, and sometimes just WPA (as opposed to WPA-PSK), is designed for enterprise networks and requires an authentication server.

It provides additional security (e.g. protection against dictionary attacks on short passwords).

Various kinds of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) are used for authentication.
