# Create Interface

The **Create New Network Interface** dialog allows you to create a new [interface](/glossary/n/network_interface) according to your needs.

##

The dialog is a wizard where you add information in several steps.

The number of steps and their contents varies depending on the type of interface you create.

**Note:** As a last step you finalize the setup, but you can further [edit the settings](../edit/start) from the [connections](../start) page.


### Connection Types

In the first step, you can choose the type of interface: `Uplink`, `Downlink`, or `Unmanaged`.

Depending on your choice in the first step, different options become available.

{{page>./uplink/start}}

{{page>./downlink/start}}

{{page>./unmanaged/start}}
