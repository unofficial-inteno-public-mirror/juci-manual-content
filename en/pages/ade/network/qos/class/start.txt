# Class

The **class** tab lets you manage QoS [classes](./classes).

## Overview

At the top of the page is a list of selectable classes.

When a particular class is selected, details about it is shown in the configuration section.

^ Item ^ Description ^ Comment ^
| Priority | Bandwidth allocation limit (%). |  |
| Average Rate | Average target rate (%). |  |
| Limit Rate | Maximum allowed [bandwidth](/glossary/b/bandwidth) (%). |  |
| Packet Size | Size of [packets](/glossary/p/packet) (bytes). | See note. |
| Packet Delay | Target [delay](/glossary/d/delay) for packets (ms). | See note. |
| Max Size | Maximum size of [packets](/glossary/p/packet) (bytes). |  |


**Note:** Packet Size and Packet Delay rely on the Average Rate setting. The average rate is impacted by the maximum packet delay and the transfer time for the packet size. Generally the delay is lower for smaller packet sizes.
