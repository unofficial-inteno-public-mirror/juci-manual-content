# Classification Group

The **Classification Group** tab lets you manage groupings of [QoS classes](/glossary/q/qos_class).

This is useful when you have multiple [interfaces](/glossary/n/network_interface) and want to manage classes differently for them.

## Overview

At the top of the page is a list of selectable classification groups.

When a particular group is selected, details about it is shown in the configuration section.

^ Item ^ Description ^ Comment ^
| Default Class | Class to use as fallback if packets don't match any other class. |
| Classes | Classes to include in the group. | **Note:** You need to [create a class](../class/start) for it to be available in the list. |

The **Default** Classgroup contains these [standard classes](../class/classes):
- **Priority**
- **Express**
- **Normal**
- **Bulk**
