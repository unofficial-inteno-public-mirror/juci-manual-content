# Parental Control

Parental control is used to restrict access to the network for particular devices.

## Internet Access Scheduling

Parental control is handled by setting schedules where access is restricted to explicitly named [MAC](/glossary/m/mac) addresses.

^ Item ^ Description ^
| Weekdays | List of days the filter applies. |
| Start Time | Time of day to start filtering. |
| Stop Time | Time of day to stop filtering. |
| MAC Addresses | List of device [MAC](/glossary/m/mac) addresses. |


### Start and Stop Times

The start time for a rule has to be lower than the end time.

If you want to have a rule that goes over midnight, you need to add two rules, one up until midnight, and one from midnight to when you want the rule to end.

For example:

Rule one: **From** `21:00` **To** `23:59`
Rule two: **From** `00:00` **To** `06:00`

A single rule of **From** `21:00` **To** `06:00` will **not** be saved.
