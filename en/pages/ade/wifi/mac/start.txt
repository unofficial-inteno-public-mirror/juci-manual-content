# MAC Filter

In the **MAC Filter** view you can make your wireless network more secure. Just specify which devices are allowed to connect, or explicitly lock out devices.

##

Filters can be applied separately for each [radio](/glossary/w/wireless_radio) .

The devices are identified by their [MAC](/glossary/m/mac) address. You can manage up to 32 devices.
