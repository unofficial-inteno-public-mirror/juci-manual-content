# Add Parental Control

The Internet Access Schedule rules you add from the client panel will only apply to that client.

## Internet Access Scheduling

Parental control is handled by setting schedules where access is restricted to explicitly named [MAC](/glossary/m/mac) addresses.

When adding a parental control filter from the client panel, the [MAC Address](/glossary/m/mac) is automatically selected from the client.

### Add an Internet Access Schedule


* Select a **Time Frame** from the menu

* Edit the selected **Days** as needed

* Enter a time:
  * **From**
  * **To**

* Click **Save**

* Click **Close**


### Start and Stop Times

The start time for a rule has to be lower than the end time.

If you want to have a rule that goes over midnight, you need to add two rules, one up until midnight, and one from midnight to when you want the rule to end.

For example:

Rule one: **From** `21:00` **To** `23:59`
Rule two: **From** `00:00` **To** `06:00`

A single rule of **From** `21:00` **To** `06:00` will **not** be saved.
