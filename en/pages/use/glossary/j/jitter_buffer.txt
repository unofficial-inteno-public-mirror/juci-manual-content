# Jitter Buffer

A jitter buffer is storage for voice packets so they can be sent out in evenly spaced intervals used to reduce [jitter](/glossary/j/jitter), providing better transmission reliability.

There are two **jitter buffer implementation** types which are used by the SIP channel reciever.

^ Implementation ^ Description ^
| Fixed | Use a fixed buffer size. |
| Adaptive | Use a variable buffer size. |
