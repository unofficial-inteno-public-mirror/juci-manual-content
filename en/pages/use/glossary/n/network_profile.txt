# Network Profile

A network profile is a global setting for your device that defines how it will work in the network.

For example, selecting a particular profile may configure your device as a wireless repeater or as a fully routed NAT gateway.

Depending on the selected profile, available features and settings will be different.

Some sample profiles:

^ Profile ^ Description ^
| Bridged IPTV | [IPTV](/glossary/i/iptv) service in a [bridged](/glossary/n/network_bridge) network. |
| VoIP + Bridged IPTV | Both [VOIP](/glossary/i/iptv) and [IPTV](/glossary/i/iptv) service in a [bridged](/glossary/n/network_bridge) network. |
| Wireless Repeater | Wireless [bridge](/glossary/n/network_bridge). |
| Fully Routed (NAT) | All features with [NAT](/glossary/n/nat) capability. |
