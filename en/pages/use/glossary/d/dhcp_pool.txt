# DHCP Pool

A DHCP pool is a collection of [IP](/glossary/i/ip) addresses available for [DHCP](/glossary/d/dhcp) allocation.

The **Pool Start** number is the first available number in the pool.

The **Pool Size** is the count of available numbers, counting from the pool start.

Example: with Pool Start of `50` and a Pool Size of `100`, the available pool addresses are `50` to `150`.
