# VC-MUX

Virtual Circuit Multiplexing (VC-MUX) is a method for identifying the protocol carried in [frames](/glossary/f/frame) used in [ATM](/glossary/a/atm).

Using virtual circuit multiplexing, hosts agree on the high-level protocol for a given circuit. Each high-level protocol requires a separate virtual circuit.
