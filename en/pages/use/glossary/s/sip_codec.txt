# SIP Codec

SIP codecs are [codecs](/glossary/c/codec) designed for use with [SIP](/glossary/s/sip) traffic.

###  G.711ALaw

G.711ALaw is a [companding](/glossary/c/companding) standard using non-linear encoding and decoding to provide pulse code modulation mainly of voice frequencies with the A-law variant algorithm.

###  G.711MuLaw

G.711MuLaw is a [companding](/glossary/c/companding) standard using non-linear encoding and decoding to provide pulse code modulation mainly of voice frequencies with the Î¼-law variant algorithm. It provides higher compression than A-Law, with higher distorion for smaller packets.

###  G.729a

G.729 is a compression standard with linear compression for voice with low bandwith rewuirements, suitable for [voip](/glossary/v/voip) applications where bandwith conservation is an issue. It divides 10ms packets for a 8kbit/s transmission rate.

###  G.726

G.726 is a compression standard using [ADPCM](/glossary/a/adpcm)to transmit voice at transmission rates of 16, 24, 32, and 40 kbit/s. The 32 kbit/s mode is the standard codec for [DECT](/glossary/d/dect) wireless phone systems.
