WMM ([WiFi](/glossary/w/wifi) Multimedia) improves quality of service on a network by prioritizing data by four configrable categories:

**Voice**: Voice packets for Voice over IP (VoIP) calls.

**Video**: Video packets for support of TV streams.

**Best effort**: Support for legacy devices or devices lacking QoS standards.

**Background**: File downloads, print jobs and other traffic that does not suffer from increased latency.
