# NAT

The **NAT** view shows a list of active [NAT](/glossary/n/nat) mappings in the device network.

### Connections

The **Active Connections** gauge shows how many NAT mappings are in use out of the allowed total, as a percentage and as a count.

### NAT Connection Table

Connections to and from the local network to the external network are added to the table, allowing the device to handle traffic routing decisions.

The table displays information about active NAT connections.
