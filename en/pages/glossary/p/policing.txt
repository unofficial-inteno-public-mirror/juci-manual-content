# Traffic Policing

Traffic Policing is a [QoS](/glossary/q/qos) process where [packets](/glossary/p/packet) are handled according to user-defined criteria. Depending on the criteria, the packets may be marked, dropped or completely ignored.

The purpose of traffic policing is to make sure that bursts in traffic hare handled and the designated traffic flows get appropriate bandwidth.
