# Port Speed

Port speed settings affect how a LAN or WAN port negotiates the speed setting.

Negotiation can be turned off (speed setting: **only**) or use [Autonegotiation](/glossary/a/auto_negotiation) (speed setting **max**) to determine actual speed.

Communication on a port can be either half or full [duplex](/glossary/d/duplex).

A port that is set to **disabled** does not handle any traffic.
