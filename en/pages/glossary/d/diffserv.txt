# Differentiated Services

Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is a method for classifying traffic and providing [quality of service](/glossary/q/qos) for [IP](/glossary/i/ip) networks.

DiffServ uses a [differentiated services code point](/glossary/d/dscp) in the IP header for packet classification purposes.

DiffServ is concerned with classifying packets as they enter the local network. This classification then applies to Flow of traffic where a Flow is defined by 5 elements;

Source IP address, Destination IP, Source port, Destination port and the transport protocol. A flow that has been classified or marked can then be acted upon by other QoS mechanisms.

Multiple flows can therefore be dealt with in a multitude of ways depending on the requirements of each flow. Packets are first Classified according to their current [DSCP](/glossary/d/dscp).

Then they are separated into queues where one queue may be routed via a marking mechanism and another queue may be examined more closely.

After further examination additional packets may be sent for marking or be sent direct to the shaping/dropping mechanisms where all packets end up before leaving the interface.
