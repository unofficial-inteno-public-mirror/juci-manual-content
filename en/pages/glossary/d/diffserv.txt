# Differentiated Services

Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is a method for classifying traffic and providing [quality of service](/glossary/q/qos) for [IP](/glossary/i/ip) networks.

DiffServ uses a [DiffServ Code Point](/glossary/d/dscp) in the IP header for packet classification purposes.

Packets entering the local network are classified into a *flow* defined by:

* Source [IP address](/glossary/i/ip_address)
* Destination [IP address](/glossary/i/ip_address)
* Source [port](/glossary/p/port)
* Destination [port](/glossary/p/port)
* [Protocol](/glossary/p/protocol)

Classified flows can be object of multiple QoS mechanisms.


### Classification Process

The classification works as follows:

1. Packets are first classified by their [DSCP](/glossary/d/dscp).

2. Packets are separated into queues for routing or examination

3. Examined packets are sent for marking or to [shaping](/glossary/s/shaping)
/[dropping](/glossary/d/dropping) mechanisms.

4. Packets leave the interface.
