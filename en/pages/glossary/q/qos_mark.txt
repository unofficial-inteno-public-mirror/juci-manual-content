# QoS Mark

The [Quality of Service](/glossary/q/qos) Mark is used when classifying traffic. Packets matching the filter will be marked with the provided hexadecimal code `0x000000`-`0xFFFFFF`.

This mark can then be used for identification and filtering purposes, for example by [iptables](/glossary/i/i√•tables) .
