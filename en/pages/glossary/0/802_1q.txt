# 802.1q

IEEE 802.1Q is a standard for Ethernet [VLANs](/glossary/v/vlan) where VLANs are given a numeric tag. The tag is used to identify traffic in networks, and decide how to handle it.

This allows multiple bridged networks to share the same physical link without leaking information to each other networks.
