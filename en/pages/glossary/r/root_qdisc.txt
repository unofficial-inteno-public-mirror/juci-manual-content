#  Root QDisc


[Quality Of Service](/glossary/q/qos)


A Root QDisc is a collection point for [packet scheduler](/glossary/q/qdisc)



, but rather the location where traffic control structures can be attached to an interface for egress (outbound traffic). It can contain any of the queuing disciplines (qdiscs) with potential classes and class structures.



Ingress QDisc

The location where ingress (incoming traffic) filters can be attached. For practical purposes, the ingress qdisc is merely a convenient object onto which to attach a policer to limit the amount of traffic accepted on a network interface.

Classless QDisc

A QDisc with no configurable internal subdivisions.

Classful QDisc

Contains multiple classes. Some of these classes contain a further QDisc, which may again be classful, but need not be.
Work-Conserving A work-conserving QDisc never delays packets. It does NOT "shape" packets.

Non-Work-Conserving

A non-work-conserving QDiscs may delay packets and "shape" them. This means that they sometimes refuse to pass a packet, even though they have one available.


Classes

Classes are sub-QDiscs which allow the user to configure QoS in more detail. Classes can contain additional classes. Classes do not have a queue, do not contain any network packets and cannot contain filters.

Leaf Class End class without any child classes. Always contains a QDisc! In case one is not configure, the default pfifo_fast is used. Leaf classes give unused bandwidth back to their parent class.

Inner Class

Classes which contain leaf-classes.

Parent Class

Parent class can dynamically pass bandwidth to leaf-classes
Child Class Class that has another class or a QDisc as parent and contains classes.

Classifier

Determines which class to send a packet.
