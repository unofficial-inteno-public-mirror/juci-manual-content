# Routing

Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic, making routing decisions to ensure that traffic moves from the source to the destination.

Dynamic routing is the most common method, where routing protocols are used to manage routing automatically.

Static routing means that routes are set up permanently using a [routing table](/glossary/r/routing_table).

Policy based routing entails selecting routes based on the type of traffic being transmitted, tryingt to use more efficient routes for priority traffic.
