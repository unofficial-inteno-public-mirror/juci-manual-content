# RSVP

The Resource ReSerVation Protocol - RSVP - is a signalling mechanism used for network management of [packets](/glossary/p/packet).

It uses a method where resources available to handle [Quality Of Service](/glossary/q/qos) traffic is broadcasted throughout the network.

Listening devices reply with a RESV (Reserve) message containing a [flow specification](/glossary/f/flow_spec) for the traffic.

Devices on the route between sender and listener either accept the reservation and handle the flow, or send a reject message.

Reservations can end normally or time out as needed.
